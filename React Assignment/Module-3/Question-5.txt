(5). What is Components in React Js?


In React.js, a component is a small, reusable piece of code that represents a part of a user interface (UI). Components are the building blocks of a React application, and they can be combined to create complex UIs.

1. Functional Components: These are simple, pure functions that take in props and return JSX (React's syntax for writing HTML-like code). Functional components do not have their own state.

2. Class Components: These are classes that extend the React.Component class. Class components have their own state and lifecycle methods.
