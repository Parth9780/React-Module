(9). How to change in components of React Js?


In React, components are the building blocks of your application's UI. To change a component, you can modify its code in the corresponding JavaScript file.

Step 1: Identify the component

    1.Open your React project in a code editor or IDE.
    2.Identify the component you want to change. Components are typically defined in separate JavaScript files, e.g., Header.js, Footer.js, Button.js, etc.
    3.Locate the file that contains the component you want to modify.

Step 2: Open the component file

    1.Open the JavaScript file that contains the component you want to change.
    2.Make sure you have the correct file open by checking the file name and the component's name.

Step 3: Modify the component code

    1.Make the necessary changes to the component's code. This can include:
        -Updating the component's props or state.
        -Changing the component's rendering logic.
        -Adding or removing child components.
        -Updating the component's styles or CSS classes.
    2.Use React's JSX syntax to write the component's code.

Step 4: Save the changes

    1.Save the changes to the component file.
    2.Make sure to save the file with the same name and in the same location as before.

Step 5: Refresh the application

    1.Go back to your web browser and refresh the page.
    2.The changes you made to the component should be reflected in the application.


Example: Changing a component's text

    // Header.js (before)
    import React from 'react';

    const Header = () => {
    return (
        <header>
        <h1>Welcome to my app!</h1>
        </header>
    );
    };

    export default Header;

    To change the title text, you would modify the Header component as follows:

    // Header.js (after)
    import React from 'react';

    const Header = () => {
    return (
        <header>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        </header>
    );
    };

    export default Header;
