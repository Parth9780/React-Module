(4). What is CLI command In React Js?

In React.js, CLI (Command Line Interface) commands are used to create, build, and manage React projects. The most commonly used CLI command in React.js is the `create-react-app` command, which is a command-line tool for creating React applications.

1. `create-react-app` <project-name>: This command is used to create a new React application with a preconfigured build setup. It creates a new directory with the specified project name and sets up the necessary files and folders for a React application.

2. `npm start`: This command is used to start the development server for a React application. It runs the application on a local development server and allows you to view the application in a web browser.

3. `npm run build`: This command is used to build a production-ready version of a React application. It creates a `build` directory with optimized and minified files that can be deployed to a production environment.

4. `npm test`: This command is used to run the test suite for a React application. It runs all the tests in the src directory and provides a report of any failed tests.

5. `npm install` <package-name>: This command is used to install a new package in a React application. It downloads the specified package and its dependencies and adds them to the `package.json` file.

6. `npm uninstall` <package-name>: This command is used to uninstall a package from a React application. It removes the specified package and its dependencies from the node_modules directory and updates the `package.json` file.

7. `npm update`: This command is used to update all the packages in a React application to their latest versions. It updates the `package.json` file and the node_modules directory with the latest versions of the installed packages.
